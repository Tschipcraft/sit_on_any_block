> A data pack for 1.14x-1.19x

## Features

This pack gives you the ability to sit on stairs and blocks.

To sit on a block, stand on it, put any items in your main hand away, look down and right-click.
Stairs work the same way, the only difference is that you don't have to specifically look down to sit on them.
These "chairs" will stay longer but will despawn if no players are around. To get rid of a chair immediately, hold any type of axe in your main hand or break the stair.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/sit_on_any_block/releases/latest) and put the data pack .zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.

For Minecraft 1.14x - 1.18x use [these legacy editions](https://github.com/Tschipcraft/sit_on_any_block/tree/master/other_editions).

## Updates

To check for updates use `/trigger menu` and hit the Check for Updates button. There is also a **Reset** and an **Uninstall** button.

## Compatibility

Data packs are usually pretty compatible with newer versions of the game. This data pack however also features a version checker which notifies you, if you are playing with an (to the data pack) unknown version. If the data pack works fine and I'm just too lazy to update the pack in time, you can turn it off with the command `/scoreboard players set tvc_ignore global 1`
