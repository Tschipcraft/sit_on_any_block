# Sit on any block

> A data pack for 1.14x-1.17x

## Features

This pack gives you the ability to sit on stairs and blocks and create benches/chairs

To sit on a block, stand on it, put any items in your main hand away, look down and right-click.
Stairs work kinda the same way, the only difference is, that you don't have to specifically look down to sit on them.
These "chairs" will stay longer but will despawn after a few minutes. To get rid of a chair immediately, hold any type of axe in your main hand or break the stair.

Partially Multiplayer compatible!
